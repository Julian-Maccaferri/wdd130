    <p>Hello! I'm Julian Maccaferri, I'm 38-year-old from Rosario, Argentina.</p>
    <p>As a divorced father of a 5-year-old son, my life is full of challenges and constant learning.</p>
    <p>My love for my son and my hometown drives me to keep growing and seeking a balance between my personal and professional life.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this course for the opportunities that brings fot the future, Web development skills are in high demand globally, 
        making it easier to find job opportunities in various industries.</p>
    <p>It's worth mentioning that, despite receiving a Christian education, I'm not a member of the church. 
        Consequently, I'm truly grateful to be a part of this class and to attend BYU.</p>
